Description: Topologically associating domains (TADs) are structural units of 
    higher-order chromatin organization. Evidence increasingly highlights the 
    association between reorganized TADs and key biological processes, including 
    disease progression. However, current methods are limited in detecting 
    fine-scale TAD reorganizations and analyzing sparse pseudo-bulk Hi-C data, 
    which is typically derived from aggregating emerging single-cell Hi-C data. 
    To address these challenges, we introduce DiffDomain-Spectrum, an enhanced 
    method for identifying reorganized TADs. Unlike DiffDomain which only uses 
    the largest eigenvalue of the normalized difference Hi-C matrix, DiffDomain
    Spectrum leverages the full distribution of all eigenvalues, enabling 
    detection of TAD reorganization not affecting the largest eigenvalue. 
    Benchmarking on truly reorganized TADs using bulk Hi-C data demonstrates 
    that DiffDomain-Spectrum captures all detections made by DiffDomain while 
    achieving a 10% higher true positive rate.
